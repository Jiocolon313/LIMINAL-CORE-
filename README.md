# LIMINAL-CORE-

Liminal Core is a single-player map set in a long-abandoned research and containment facility buried deep beneath the surface. Once operated by a now-defunct tech conglomerate, the complex was designed to experiment with interdimensional gateways â€” but something went wrong, and the site was sealed indefinitely.
